<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Clone the repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/TheSlugInTub/Salmon-Engine.git`,<br> although you must have git installed. If you don't have git then you can just download the source code off github.</p>
<h2>Compiling the engine</h2>
<p>Salmon Engine uses CMake as its build tool, you must have it installed.</p>
<p>Open command prompt, change directory into the folder where you downloaded the source code. <br>Make a build folder, change directory to the build folder, type `cmake ..` to generate build files.</p>
<p>Once build files are generated, change directory to the root directory and type `cmake --build build/`<br>to compile the engine, compiling takes a long time, have a coffee break while you're at it.</p>

<p>If you want to integrate the engine into your own project, copy the 'src' and 'include' <br> directories into your own project's source and include directories. <br> And copy the 'shaders' and 'res' directories into your project's root directory.</p>
