                <h1>Salmon ECS</h1>
                <p>Salmon Engine uses an ECS (Entity component system) paradigm as its design structure.</p>
                <p>If you don't quite understand how an ECS works, an ECS has three main components (pun not intended),<br> entities, components, and systems. Entities are IDs, just numbers really. A component, which is a struct of data,<br> can be associated with that entity ID. So you can create entities and assign components to them.<br> Systems are logic, the engine treats systems as functions that are run every frame, they can loop over entities <br> with specific components and do logic on them.</p>

            <p>Here's how to use the ECS in the engine:</p>
            <h2>Scenes</h2>
            <p>Scenes hold entities, they're like a registry of sorts, here's how to make one: </p>
            <pre class="code">
Scene scene;</pre>

            <h2>Entities</h2>
            <p>Here's how you can make an entity:</p>
            <pre class="code">
EntityID ent = scene.AddEntity();</pre>

            <h2>Components</h2>

            <p>Make a struct of whatever you want.</p>

            <pre class="code">
struct Position
{
    float x, y, z;
};</pre>
            <p>Then assign the component to an entity.</p>

            <pre class="code">
scene.Assign&lt;Position&gt;(ent);</pre>

            <p>If your struct has a constructor, or you just need to initialize values, then: </p>

            <pre class="code">
scene.AssignParam&lt;Position&gt;(ent, 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);</pre>

            <p>The arguments after 'ent' would be the constructor.</p>
            <p>If you want to retrieve a component from an entity then: </p>
            <pre class="code">
Position* pos = scene.Get&lt;Position&lt;(ent);</pre>
            <p>This returns a pointer to the component you have assigned to the entity.</p>
            <h2>Systems</h2>
            <p>Systems are treated as functions that are run every frame in the engine. You can either run them manually yourself, or use this macro:</p>
            <pre class="code">
REGISTER_SYSTEM(SystemType);</pre>
            <p>This will add your system (function), to a list of functions in the ECS, which you can execute each frame by calling UpdateSystems() in your main loop.</p>

            <p>"Why the hell is this macro here?", you might ask. Well this is just so I don't have to manually call each and every system<br> I create in the main function, I think it makes code messier that way, registering each system in another file, and calling them all just seems a bit cleaner to me.</p>
