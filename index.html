            Salmon Engine is a game engine built in C++ primarily built for 3d games.<br>
            It's not much of a game engine really, it's a game framework that you can include in your projects and use to make games.<br><br>
            Salmon Engine has an ECS (Entity Component System) architecture, this improves performance and makes it much nicer to work with.<br>
            This means that you can make entities (unsigned integers which are just IDs), attach components (structs) to the IDs, and make systems (functions) that loop over all the IDs with certain components. You can also retrieve the components from these IDs and change them of course.<br><br>
            The engine has a 3D renderer which uses OpenGL, it includes shadow mapping
